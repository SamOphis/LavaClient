## Contributing

Thanks for contributing! I don't have much time these days and as a result I appreciate the help in making LavaClient a better project for both me and its users. Here's how you can contribute to LavaClient directly:

- Firstly, the coding style you used must match that of the rest of the LavaClient code. Different coding styles makes it harder for all of us to read.
- Secondly, if you have edited the main, "public" files such as [entity interfaces](https://github.com/SamOphis/LavaClient/tree/master/src/main/java/samophis/lavalink/client/entities), utility classes, builders, etc. you must javadoc the additions/changes, again, to the same standard used in the rest of the project.
- Thirdly (and finally), you must have tested your contribution in a simulated or actual production environment for at least a short while (as in a couple hours ideally) in order to minimize the amount of bugs and issues present in the code.

In LavaClient, we favour performance, simplicity and structure over space. If an actual developer looks at LavaClient and gets stumbled by it, it means the project is too messy or complex. As a result, strict contribution guidelines are in place to make it so that the above issue doesn't happen. Your contribution must satisfy these needs in order to be merged/approved!
