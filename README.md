LavaClient is a fast, lightweight and abstract client implementation for [Lavalink](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink), meant to make music functionality in Discord bots much nicer and easier. It's asynchronous and tries to be as safe as possible by keeping track of local state and logging frequently.

## Using LavaClient in a project
It is not recommended to use LavaClient in any project as of the 17th February 2019, as it is currently in the middle of a rewrite. Feel free to check out the old, unsupported (but fully-documented) legacy branch of LavaClient. It's stable but also several times heavier, slower, harder to use and it's also unsupported now that v4 is a thing.
